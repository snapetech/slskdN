# Release Checklist

## Purpose

This is the minimum release-readiness checklist for `slskdn`.

Green local validation means the tree is a viable release candidate. It does not replace the tag-triggered CI build/publish path.

## Minimum local release bar

Run this from repo root:

```bash
bash packaging/scripts/run-release-gate.sh
bash ./bin/lint
```

If the release claims to fix a reported bug, also run the reproduce-first workflow in [bugfix-verification-checklist.md](bugfix-verification-checklist.md). Green generic validation is not enough on its own.

The release gate now covers:

- branch sync with the tracked upstream before tagging
- packaging metadata validation
- frontend unit tests
- frontend production build
- built-web output verification
- served-under-subpath web smoke (`/slskd/`)
- backend unit tests
- backend smoke/regression tests
- targeted backend integration smoke tests:
  - `LoadTests`
  - `DisasterModeIntegrationTests`
  - `SoulbeetAdvancedModeTests`
  - `CanonicalSelectionTests`
  - `LibraryHealthTests`

## What green local validation proves

- the repo builds
- the release gate passes on the current tree
- critical packaged-web and startup/API smoke paths are covered
- a small release-surface integration slice is working

## What it does not prove

- tag-triggered packaging/publish workflows succeeded
- every platform package installed cleanly
- every slow or environment-sensitive E2E path is green
- a tester-reported bug is fixed unless the same reported path was re-run successfully

## Release flow

1. Get the tree green locally:
   - `bash packaging/scripts/run-release-gate.sh`
   - `bash ./bin/lint`
2. For any build that claims to fix a reported issue:
   - capture the repro contract
   - split multi-symptom reports into separate acceptance checks
   - re-run the same path after the patch
   - identify any symptoms that remain unverified
3. Move the shipped user-facing bullets from `## [Unreleased]` into an exact
   version section in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, for example:
   `## [2026072717-slskdn.292] — 2026-07-27`. The section must contain at least
   one meaningful highlight; empty, placeholder, or “no recorded changes” notes
   are release-blocking.
4. Preview and validate the exact notes when needed:
   - `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh <version> /tmp/release-notes.md <git-ref>`
   - `scripts/validate-release-notes.sh <version> /tmp/release-notes.md`
5. Push the code branch normally if needed.
6. Only trigger build/release by running the guarded tag helper when explicitly desired:
   - `scripts/create-release-tag.sh build-main-YYYYMMDDHH-slskdn.N`
   - `scripts/create-release-tag.sh build-dev-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.dev.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`
7. After GitHub publishes the release, verify the actual assets:
   - `scripts/verify-release-artifacts.sh <tag>`

Do not rely on a normal branch push to validate packaging or publish artifacts. This repo builds releases on tags.
Do not create or push plain `slskdn.N` tags for releases; those do not run the release packaging workflow.

The guarded tag helper validates the versioned changelog section before doing
the expensive release gate or creating a tag. The hosted workflow generates
the notes again from the tagged source and validates them immediately before
the GitHub release write. Both paths fail closed on missing titles/dates,
missing or short highlights, and placeholder wording.

## Recommended extra checks for risky changes

Run these when the change touches the relevant surface:

- Packaging/workflow changes:
  - `bash packaging/scripts/validate-packaging-metadata.sh`
  - `bash packaging/scripts/run-nix-package-smoke.sh`
- Frontend hosting/base-path changes:
  - `npm --prefix src/web run build`
  - `node src/web/scripts/verify-build-output.mjs`
  - `node src/web/scripts/smoke-subpath-build.mjs`
- Browser/user-journey changes:
  - use the existing Playwright workflow or local E2E smoke
- Packaging or distro-specific changes:
  - perform the relevant platform install smoke before tagging

## Release decision rule

Do not call a build "release-ready" unless:

- local release gate is green
- lint is green
- any claimed bugfix has passed its issue-specific repro/acceptance checks, or is clearly labeled as an unverified mitigation
- no known release-blocking packaging issue is open for the touched platform
- the tag-triggered build is the next intended step

## Orphaned-change guard

The release source of truth is the pushed branch head plus a `build-main-*` or
`build-dev-*` tag created by `scripts/create-release-tag.sh`. The helper refuses
dirty trees, local-only commits, stale upstream branches, duplicate local/remote
tags, and invalid tag names before it runs the full release gate and pushes the
tag. The post-release artifact verifier then checks the downloaded GitHub assets
for checksums, the VPN helper payload, and the bundled Web footer session-total
marker so a release cannot silently miss recently merged aggregate code.
