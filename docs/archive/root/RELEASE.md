**MediaCore ↔ Shadow Index:**
- MediaCore queries Shadow Index for content discovery (Shadow Index provides MBID→peer mappings)
- Shadow Index uses MediaCore's Content Descriptors for content addressing

**PodCore ↔ Mesh:**
- PodCore uses Mesh DHT for pod discovery (Pods published to DHT)
- PodCore uses Mesh overlay for messaging (Pod messages sent via overlay)

**Security ↔ All Systems:**
- Security verifies all DHT data (Mesh, MediaCore, PodCore)
- Security rate-limits all network operations
- Security quarantines malicious peers (affects all systems)

**VirtualSoulfind ↔ Disaster Mode:**
- VirtualSoulfind triggers Disaster Mode when Soulseek unavailable
- Disaster Mode uses VirtualSoulfind's Shadow Index for content discovery
