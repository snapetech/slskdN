# slskdn Unraid Template

This template is the Community Applications package metadata for slskdN.

## Community Applications

The repository-level profile required by the current Community Applications submission portal is at [`ca_profile.xml`](../../ca_profile.xml). Submit the public GitHub repository through [Community Applications](https://ca.unraid.net/submit/new) after reviewing the [submission help](https://ca.unraid.net/submit/help).

Until the listing is approved, use the [template XML](https://github.com/snapetech/slskdN/raw/refs/heads/main/packaging/unraid/slskdn.xml) as a local user template. Copy it to `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/slskdn.xml` on the Unraid flash, then open **Docker → Add Container → User Templates** and select `slskdn`.

The old **Settings → Docker → Template Repositories** instructions are obsolete on current Unraid releases.

## Default Paths

| Setting | Container Path | Default / Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| App Data | `/app` | `/mnt/user/appdata/slskdn` |
| Downloads | `/downloads` | Choose a share and directory before starting |
| Music Library | `/music` | Optional; choose a read-only share and directory |

## Default Ports

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 5030 | Web UI (HTTP) |
| 5031 | Web UI (HTTPS) |
| 50300/tcp | Soulseek incoming connections (plain and obfuscated peer connections share this one port by default) |
| 50305/tcp | slskdN mesh overlay (a distinct number from 50300 because both are TCP) |
| 50300/udp | Public DHT rendezvous, mesh overlay control, and QUIC control/data-plane traffic, all sharing one UDP socket |

Port 50300/tcp should be forwarded in your router for optimal Soulseek
connectivity. Ports 50305/tcp and 50300/udp are used when DHT/mesh services are
enabled; 50300/udp shares the Soulseek listen port's number since TCP and UDP
are separate port spaces. The loopback-only QUIC backend ports (55305 and
55401) must not be published.

## First Run

1. Access the web UI at `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP:5030`
2. Default login: `slskd` / `slskd`
3. Go to **System** → Configure your Soulseek username/password
4. Configure your shared folders under **System** → **Shares**

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PUID` | User ID for file permissions | 1000 |
| `PGID` | Group ID for file permissions | 1000 |
| `TZ` | Timezone | America/Chicago |
| `SLSKD_USERNAME` | Web UI username | slskd; change it |
| `SLSKD_PASSWORD` | Web UI password | slskd; change it |
| `SLSKD_SLSK_USERNAME` | Soulseek username | (set in UI) |
| `SLSKD_SLSK_PASSWORD` | Soulseek password | (set in UI) |

The template also exposes the documented optional `SLSKD_*` environment
overrides as advanced fields with blank values. Leave them blank to use the
image and YAML defaults. This includes less-common settings for downloads,
shares, search, Soulseek behavior, obfuscation, proxies, authentication,
metrics, notifications, logging, and integrations. The complete variable
reference is in [`docs/config.md`](../../docs/config.md). Runtime-only
`SLSKD_SCRIPT_DATA` and image metadata variables such as `SLSKD_DOCKER_TAG` are
not user configuration fields.

Blank optional variable fields may be passed by Unraid as variables such as
`SLSKD_HEADLESS=`. slskdN treats empty `SLSKD_*` values as unset, so they do not
cause Boolean or numeric configuration-binding errors and do not override the
YAML or image default. Enter an explicit value when an override is wanted.

Downloads is a required Unraid path field and must be filled with the share and
directory you want to use before the container is started. Completed files use
`/downloads`; incomplete files use `/app/incomplete`, which is created in the
writable App Data mapping. Music Library remains optional; leave it unmounted
when no read-only share should be exposed.

Image-managed Docker runtime settings are also visible in the advanced section
with their safe image defaults. Do not combine `PUID`/`PGID` with a Docker
`--user` override.

## Template usability feedback

Community feedback requested that Docker environment variables be exposed in
the template and left blank when optional, so users do not have to hunt through
documentation for settings that were omitted from the template. The current
template follows that approach while keeping required values and image runtime
defaults safe.
