## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Preserved the existing `DbUpdateException` boundary when atomic share-group
  member admission encounters a database constraint failure.
- Registered the ordered download auto-retry index migration so application
  startup applies it to existing transfer databases.

### Changed

  instead of materializing a regex match object for every token.
- SongID transcript trigram repetition now streams token ranges and aggregates
  distinct trigrams without regex match, token, n-gram, or grouping buffers.

  common ASCII filename keys without allocating lowercase path copies.
- IPLD graph construction now pre-sizes bounded coordinator collections from
  root fan-out and reuses the shared empty array for leaf outgoing links.
- IPLD inbound-link lookup now uses a source-ordered reverse target index
  instead of scanning every outgoing source and link for each query.
- IPLD graph construction now passes each hydrated node into recursion instead
  of rebuilding its outgoing and incoming link snapshots.
- Music-domain variant projection now deduplicates HashDb variant IDs before
  allocating returned `MediaVariant` objects and grouping state.
- Shadow Index descriptor projection now selects its best variant in one pass
  and sorts/formats only structurally distinct hash-prefix representatives.
- Descriptor version generation now streams bounded UTF-8 chunks directly into
  SHA-256 and formats its compact output from stack buffers.
- Descriptor batch publishing now uses a fixed five-worker pool instead of
  creating one semaphore-waiting async task per descriptor.
- Descriptor batch retrieval now uses a fixed 10-worker pool instead of creating
  one semaphore-waiting async task per requested ContentID.
- Descriptor cache domain queries now parse keys without allocations and bound
  newest-distinct result ordering instead of sorting/grouping every match.
- Descriptor cache cleanup, statistics, size estimation, and clear accounting
  now use direct passes instead of snapshots, key buffers, and boxed LINQ sums.
- Combine-all metadata merging now aggregates ordered distinct hashes and scalar
  fields in one source pass instead of building duplicate lists and rescanning.
- Metadata export checksums now stream JSON segments directly into SHA-256
  instead of materializing complete UTF-16 and UTF-8 payload copies.
- Metadata merge preference strategies now select their winning source in one
  pass instead of copying and ordering every source.
- Levenshtein fuzzy scoring now removes invariant-case shared affixes before
  allocating lowercase comparison strings.
- Soundex fuzzy scoring now scans and invariant-cases only contributing letters
  instead of normalizing and filtering complete input payloads into copies.

  allocating the complete downsampled signal first.
- Chromaprint hashing now reuses immutable Hann and normal-rate FFT-bin mapping
  tables instead of rebuilding them for every audio hash.

  work buffers on the stack instead of allocating them per hash/frame.

  stack buffers instead of allocating full intermediate strings and arrays.
- Common security connection fingerprints now use bounded recent reads,
  single-pass queries/statistics/eviction, and atomic event-log sizing.
- Filtered connection-fingerprint queries now enumerate dictionary entries
  directly instead of allocating an implicit values snapshot before sorting.
- Connection-event retention now uses atomic queue-size accounting instead of
  recounting the concurrent queue on every event and statistics read.
- Recent connection-event retrieval now retains only the requested tail instead
  of reverse-buffering the complete 10,000-event audit queue.
- Connection fingerprint retention now finds the oldest capped entry in one
  pass instead of snapshotting and sorting all tracked fingerprints.
- Connection fingerprint statistics now aggregate directly in one dictionary
  pass instead of snapshotting and repeatedly scanning all fingerprints.

  the first advertisable item instead of buffering every mapping.

  sorting and allocating the complete result list.

  within each search instead of retrieving the target for every candidate.
- IPLD link validation now reuses registry membership results within each run
  and checks each orphan source once instead of once per outgoing link.
- Advanced peer discovery ranking now batch-loads local peer metrics instead of
  issuing one serialized HashDb lookup per discovered peer.
- Multi-source canonical skip decisions now read one best local variant instead
  of hydrating and sorting every variant for the recording.
- MediaCore recording-ID fallback now asks HashDb for one deduplicated best
  variant instead of loading and sorting every variant for the recording.

  access query instead of loading every grant accessible to the user.

  existence query instead of loading and scanning every collection item.
- Single-grant authorization now resolves one active grant by ID and checks
  only its group membership instead of loading every accessible grant.
- Collection item updates now resolve one scoped item by ID instead of loading
  and scanning the collection's complete ordered item list.
- Peer-ID share-group member removal now deletes one matching legacy row with
  one atomic SQLite command instead of reading and hydrating it first.
- Collection-item append now assigns and returns its next ordinal in the same
  atomic SQLite insert instead of issuing a separate maximum-ordinal query.
- Share-group member admission now uses one atomic conditional SQLite insert
  instead of a duplicate read followed by a separate write.
- Collection reordering now writes ordinals through bounded transactional
  SQLite updates instead of hydrating and tracking the complete collection.
- Key-unique Sharing deletes now execute as one atomic SQLite command instead
  of reading and hydrating an entity before deleting it.
- Incoming collection announcements now replace existing items with one
  set-based SQLite delete instead of hydrating and deleting every old item.

  case-insensitive index instead of loading every rule for the item.

  opening one contact query and DbContext per peer-backed member.

  hydrating metrics instead of loading and sorting every persisted peer.
- Warm-cache access touches now update only their timestamp through one atomic
  SQLite command.

  indexed exact lookup instead of loading the complete Wishlist.
- Music metadata fallback matching now queries one bounded best-variant sample
  instead of loading every variant recording ID before batch hydration.

  seeds, reuse one Wishlist snapshot, and index search-text membership.
- Lidarr wanted synchronization and Wishlist CSV imports now persist new items
  with bounded multi-row SQLite inserts.
- Canonical audio-stat ranking and full recomputation now batch stored stats,
  variant hydration, and bounded multi-row persistence.
- Discography coverage now batches cached releases, tracks, and recording-hash
  evidence, and indexes Wishlist search text for constant-time membership tests.
- Discography and label-crate status reads now aggregate child state in one
  pass and persist the parent only when derived fields change.
- HashDb history backfill now ingests each retained search page through one
  batched transaction instead of one transaction per search.
- Library Health scans now checkpoint durable progress every 100 files instead
  of rewriting scan status after every file.
- Discography and label-crate release-job persistence now uses normalized,
  bounded multi-row SQLite upserts.
- HashDb statistics now aggregate peer, inventory, and hash counts through one
  SQLite snapshot command.
- Album-target persistence now replaces normalized track lists with bounded
  multi-row SQLite inserts instead of one command per track.
- HashDb mesh synchronization now classifies existing hashes through bounded
  indexed batches and inserts new hashes with transactional multi-row writes.
- HashDb peer activity and capability writes now use single atomic SQLite
  upserts instead of read-before-write existence checks.
- Passive FLAC discovery and history backfill now persist inventory and peer
  records with bounded multi-row SQLite upserts.
- Library Health remediation now targets requested and job-linked issues through
  indexed reads and applies state changes with bounded set-based updates.
- Music tag matching now batches candidate album tracks, recording presence,
  and bounded fallback variants instead of querying each album and recording.
- Recent music enumeration now pushes its global item limit into an indexed
  album-track query and batches recording-presence checks.
- Music recording-ID resolution now uses a direct case-insensitive indexed
  album-track lookup and defers variant hydration until the track lookup misses.
- MusicBrainz album completion now batches release-track and recording-hash
  evidence reads instead of issuing one database query per album and track.
- Library Bloom album analysis now loads release tracks in indexed batches and
  uses set-based held-recording membership instead of per-release queries and
  nested linear scans.
- SignalBus receive deduplication now uses atomic concurrent-cache admission
  instead of serializing every signal through one global semaphore.
- Source Discovery now persists returned files with bounded multi-row SQLite
  upserts instead of compiling and executing one command per file.
- Library Health release completeness checks now coalesce files by release and
  directory, then query all track recording IDs in indexed batches instead of
  repeating the complete album analysis for every file.
- Scheduled file retention now streams directory entries and resolves each
  candidate once instead of materializing all names and reevaluating the same
  lazy filesystem pipeline three times.
- Intent queue batches now reuse their loaded pending records behind atomic
  status claims, and skip whole-queue statistics hydration when debug logging
  is disabled.
- Library Health scan status polling now pauses in hidden tabs, preserves its
  one-minute deadline, and schedules each check after the previous request
  completes so slow responses cannot create overlapping work.
- Wishlist “mark all viewed” now uses one set-based update instead of loading
  and tracking every matching item.
- Pod deletion now removes messages, members, and membership history with
  bounded set-based database commands instead of tracking every child row.
- Share scan completion now queries advertisable content IDs directly instead
  of enumerating every file and loading its mappings individually.
- Wishlist and Auto-Replace search completion polling now reads lightweight
  state projections and hydrates final response payloads once.
- Share content-peer hint publication now drains deduplicated bounded batches
  and updates the shared peer-content DHT index once per batch.
- Backfill candidate scheduling now batches daily peer counters and reuses the
  snapshot through each cycle instead of querying every counter twice.
- Periodic Pod discovery publication now loads one listed-only database
  snapshot, publishes its metadata without per-Pod reloads, and refreshes the
  shared listed-Pod index once per cycle instead of once per Pod.
- Mesh bootstrap now publishes the initial self descriptor once and leaves all
  periodic and IP-change refreshes to the configured refresh service, removing
  duplicate DHT writes and active STUN detection every 30 minutes.
- Search retention, legacy pruning, and completed-history clearing now process
  stable 250-search pages with one set-based delete per page instead of loading
  the full candidate set and opening one database transaction per search.
- Automatic search retention now honors its configured cleanup interval instead
  of evaluating the database policy every five minutes. Cleanup runs cannot
  overlap, and failed runs remain eligible for the next clock evaluation.
- Shadow Index publishing now rotates through bounded indexed recording-ID
  pages, avoids full-library sorting and materialization, and does not build
  more shard candidates than the immediate DHT write budget can admit. The
  configured Virtual Soulfind DHT operation limit is now honored.
- Download auto-retry now reads an indexed, minimal oldest-first candidate
  stream and stops once its bounded global/per-peer plan is final instead of
  materializing the complete retained failure history on every cycle.
- System Bridge dashboard polling now stops while hidden, coalesces overlapping
  requests, ignores uptime-only response churn, retries failed initial config
  hydration, and retains its last successful snapshot. Synced lyrics now follow
  media/seek events without a redundant fixed 500 ms timer.
- Security dashboard statistics now aggregate each retained collector set in a
  single pass instead of repeatedly materializing and rescanning it. System
  Security polling is visible-only, non-overlapping, preserves unchanged and
  last-successful snapshots, and renders only the selected dynamic tab; the
  previously blank Status body and broken Adversarial tab selection are fixed.
- Mesh transport stats, Network snapshots, and health checks now report the
  last NAT result without triggering STUN detection during diagnostic reads.
  System Mesh polling is also visible-only, non-overlapping, Strict Mode-safe,
  and preserves unchanged or last-successful snapshots. The System polling
  lifecycle gate now enforces Strict Mode-safe mounted-ref setup across its
  complete component inventory.
- Compact listen-along panels no longer fetch the global radio directory they
  do not render. Full directory views now poll once per visible minute without
  overlap or transient cache loss, while the backend coalesces concurrent
  callers onto one process-wide DHT hydration and reuses it for one minute.
- Library Health now loads its System dashboard through one bounded SQLite
  snapshot instead of four paged entity reads, reports full-set summary and
  grouping counts beyond 100 issues, uses an indexed recent-issue page, and
  rejects limits that could disable SQLite pagination.
- Lidarr dashboard status polling now pauses while the document is hidden,
  rejects overlapping refreshes, coalesces rapid duplicate external status
  requests, and preserves React state when every rendered status field is
  unchanged.
- Search download-history ranking now uses one database aggregate instead of
  materializing the complete retained download history, and short-lived client
  reuse prevents repeated detail navigation from rerunning the same summary.
- Search results now batch cached user-group metadata for visible peers, reuse
  response-provided speed, queue, and slot data, and wait for user interaction
  before loading reputation and opinion details. Initial result rendering no
  longer contacts every remote peer for duplicate user information.
- MediaCore ContentID statistics and domain/type lookups now use
  mutation-maintained indexes instead of reparsing the complete registry on
  every read. The System MediaCore page also stops stats polling while hidden,
  rejects overlapping refreshes, and suppresses unchanged rerenders.
- Live search progress now uses a background-owned one-second hub cadence
  without rewriting incomplete response rows, while response payload hydration
  waits for completion or explicitly persisted early mesh results. Search state
  projections also preserve source and wishlist provenance.
- Browse progress now polls once per second without overlapping requests,
  suppresses unchanged state updates, stops before starting in hidden tabs, and
  catches up immediately when the document becomes visible.
- Swarm Analytics now builds all rendered dashboard sections from one peer
  snapshot and one HTTP request, omits unused trend hydration, suppresses
  overlapping or unchanged refreshes, and stops polling while hidden.
- Port Forwarding now loads a bounded available-port preview and VPN member
  counts only when their tabs open, polls authoritative status on a
  non-overlapping visible-only cadence, and renders real forwarder performance
  data instead of synthetic statistics.
- Messaging V2's active room/Pod member rail now uses a non-overlapping,
  visible-only ten-second cadence and preserves cached members on transient
  failures. Pod member responses reuse authorization snapshots and aggregate
  membership timestamps in SQLite instead of materializing retained events.
- App-wide transfer speed polling now uses projected active rows and grouped
  database totals instead of materializing complete download and upload
  histories. Footer speed and network timers pause while the browser document
  is hidden and refresh immediately when it becomes visible.
- The Jobs page and swarm visualization now separate two-second live status
  from ten-second trace aggregation, retain unchanged/cached state, reject
  overlapping requests, and suspend all polling while the browser document is
  hidden.
- Transfer reconciliation now seeds only actionable records through a
  server-watermarked, indexed change feed instead of loading the complete
  download/upload history. Successful history loads in stable 250-record pages
  only when requested, while total tab counts remain accurate. The transfer
  page merges deltas without rerendering unchanged data, rejects overlapping
  requests, and stops polling and applying live events while hidden.
- Active private-chat polling now requests only messages newer than an
  overlapping timestamp cursor, merges them into a bounded client cache, avoids
  overlapping or unchanged refreshes, and stops legacy-chat polling while the
  browser document is hidden. Private-message timeline reads use a composite
  username/timestamp index.
- The legacy Pods route now reuses list metadata, polls Pod metadata every
  sixty seconds, merges channel messages incrementally into a bounded cache,
  and stops all polling while hidden.
- Unified Messaging and the legacy Rooms route now request only room messages
  newer than an overlapping timestamp cursor, merge stable message identities
  into bounded client caches, and avoid repeatedly transferring the retained
  room history. Legacy Rooms also polls membership on a separate bounded
  cadence, suppresses overlapping or unchanged work, and stops all hydration
  while the browser document is hidden.
- Active Pod streams now use incremental cursor polling with a bounded local
  message cache, while shared message polling pauses in hidden tabs and rejects
  overlapping slow refreshes.
- Messaging V2 now consumes channel metadata directly from the saved-pod list,
  refreshes pod/discovery metadata every sixty seconds separately from
  conversation/room lists, deduplicates unchanged or overlapping work, and
  suspends both hydration cadences while hidden.
- Conversation-list unread counts are now projected by SQLite through a
  covering acknowledgement/username index instead of materializing unread
  message bodies and rescanning them once per conversation.
- Footer and System Network aggregate status now comes from one bounded server
  snapshot per consumer instead of browser-side request fan-out; Network polling
  also pauses while hidden and cannot overlap a slow prior cycle.
- Global direct-message navigation polling now uses an indexed scalar activity
  endpoint instead of loading and aggregating full conversation/message rows
  every ten seconds.
- `Program.cs` no longer contains the large experimental feature registration
  graph; multi-source, VirtualSoulfind, MediaCore, pods, mesh/DHT, wishlist,
  relay, FTP, AudioCore metadata, discovery, and notification registrations now
  live under `Bootstrap/ExperimentalFeatureGraphServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- User notes, collections/sharing, identity/friends, and Solid/WebID
  registrations now live under `Bootstrap/UserDataServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- Core database context setup, messaging/search/share/user services, transfer
  services, and source ranking now live under
  `Bootstrap/CoreApplicationServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- Startup options, feature gates, managed state, HTTP clients, Soulseek client
  construction, and `IApplication` hosting now live under
  `Bootstrap/ApplicationHostServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- ASP.NET service registration, including auth, controllers, SignalR, health
  checks, rate limiting, and Swagger, now lives under
  `Bootstrap/WebServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- ASP.NET request-pipeline and endpoint registration now lives under
  `Bootstrap/WebApplicationPipelineExtensions`.
- Top-level runtime service composition now lives under
  `Bootstrap/RuntimeServiceCollectionExtensions`.
- Integration and media-adjacent registrations now live under
  `Bootstrap/IntegrationAndMediaServiceCollectionExtensions`.

### Fixed

- Transfer removal events now carry the stable download-request identity, so
  request-backed rows disappear immediately instead of surviving until a REST
  reconciliation.
- Private-chat unread totals now count the complete conversation rather than
  the bounded message window, and ISO-formatted chat and room timestamps retain
  their real ordering instead of being treated as zero.
- Direct legacy Pod channel URLs now hydrate Pod detail, membership, and
  messages instead of treating route parameters as already-loaded state.
- System Network now normalizes peer and swarm-job response shapes, so live
  mesh peers, discovered clients, and active swarm progress are no longer
  silently discarded as malformed arrays.
- Mesh preview producers now retain ownership of their pipe writer until a
  single final completion, so hash mismatches and peer failures return clean
  end-of-stream responses instead of intermittently leaving readers pending.
- Wishlist results can now persistently ignore one peer folder for one saved
  search without blocking the peer. Ignored folders are excluded from result
  display, hit counts, album candidates, and auto-download selection, can be
  restored from the wishlist editor, and filters support quoted phrase
  exclusions for recurring title collisions.
- Wishlist-adjacent pages now cap large client-side renders: Lidarr seeded
  wishlist rows, search history, collections, contacts, incoming shares, and
  share manifests page their visible rows instead of rendering entire datasets
  at once.
- Release creation now has a guarded helper that verifies the GitHub target,
  branch sync, duplicate tags, and the full release gate before pushing a
  `build-main-*` or `build-dev-*` tag. Post-publish artifact verification now
  fails if checksums, the VPN helper payload, or the bundled footer session
  transfer marker are missing.
- Docker release publishing now copies the VPN helper project into the publish
  stage before running the shared publish script, so container images can include
  the same helper payload as archive releases.
- Release and CI workflows now pin the exact .NET SDK from `global.json`, and
  packaging validation rejects broad SDK selectors that can drift during
  self-contained publish jobs.
- `global.json` is now tracked and validated so remote tag builds see the same
  SDK pin as local release gates.
- Linux distro packages now rewrite bundled VPN helper systemd units to the
  packaged `/usr/bin` helper path and packaged `slskd` service/config names.
- Debian/PPA package builds now avoid Bash-only brace expansion in
  `debian/rules`, and the PPA workflow runs a binary-package preflight before
  uploading source packages to Launchpad.
- Arch installs now print explicit `.pacnew` guidance when pacman preserves an
  existing `/etc/slskd/slskd.yml`.
- The network endpoint ports banner is now a compact one-line notice, and once
  dismissed it stays dismissed across VPN port changes and future installs that
  keep the same browser profile.
- Downloads now accept common Windows-rooted remote Soulseek paths as remote
  store names while still blocking traversal outside the local target
  directory.
- Rescue-mode skips caused by unresolved MusicBrainz Recording IDs now log at
  debug level instead of flooding warning logs for expected metadata misses.
- Failed, aborted, timed-out, rejected, and cancelled transfers no longer appear
  as user-facing "Completed" rows. Hide/clear completed now applies only to
  successful 100% transfers, so retryable downloads stay visible and are not
  bulk-purged as completed.
- Queue-position lookup timeouts now return a controlled timeout response
  instead of producing duplicate application error logs for normal remote peer
  unavailability.
- Distributed Soulseek search requests now accept opaque signed 32-bit tokens, matching live peer traffic and stopping valid negative-token searches from being dropped after login.
- Gluetun VPN status polling now uses a no-redirect local-control HTTP client, so loopback/private configured Gluetun endpoints such as `http://127.0.0.1:8010` are no longer blocked by the public outbound SSRF guard.
- Search API timeout values now honor the documented seconds unit before mapping to Soulseek's millisecond timeout, and multi-source discovery now uses its intended multi-minute search window instead of an accidental sub-second window.
- Background auto-replace searches now charge the Soulseek search safety limiter to an `auto-replace` source instead of the user/API `user` bucket, so stuck-download maintenance cannot starve manual searches. Search completion logs now include source, state, Soulseek response count, mesh response count, merged response count, file count, and duration for live diagnosis.
- Mesh QUIC is now explicitly opt-in after recurring native host coredumps under active MsQuic listeners. UDP overlay remains enabled by default, while QUIC control/data services and clients register only when configured.
- COPR release publishing now installs Ubuntu's MIT Kerberos HTTPS KDC proxy
  and PKINIT packages, Kerberos development headers, and explicitly sources the
  Fedora realm drop-in before using Fedora Kerberos. It also installs
  `requests-gssapi` so `copr-cli` can authenticate to the COPR API with the
  Kerberos ticket during tag and recovery uploads. The Kerberos realm mapping
  now covers COPR's `fedorainfracloud.org` API domain as well as Fedora identity
  hosts, and GSSAPI auth now targets the kerberized `copr.fedoraproject.org`
  API alias. Standalone COPR recovery now uses the same existing-project upload
  shape as tag releases instead of trying to recreate, modify, or override
  project settings during recovery, and emits COPR's server response when
  recovery uploads fail with non-JSON API output.
- Soulseek.NET listener socket disposal from `Soulseek.Network.Tcp.Listener.ListenContinuouslyAsync` is now classified as expected network teardown instead of fake fatal unobserved-task telemetry.
- Verbose startup `[DI]` tracepoints, SPA fallback route serving, and per-request MediaCore CSRF processing logs now emit at debug level; controlled offline user-info responses and shutdown-cancelled background searches no longer log exception/error noise.
- User info lookups now return a controlled `503` for expected Soulseek peer connection failures and timeouts instead of bubbling live peer unavailability as HTTP 500s.
- Release-gate tests now handle expected content-verification cancellation without leaking active probe accounting.
- Mesh transfer terminal failures now populate sanitized error details before exposing the `Failed` state to pollers.
- Messaging slash-command tests now wait for controlled composer state before pressing Enter, preventing full-suite release-gate flakes.

### SongID

- Added a native `SongID` feature in the Search page beside MusicBrainz.
- `SongID` accepts YouTube URLs, Spotify URLs, direct text queries, and server-side local file paths.
- Added a durable background queue with configurable concurrent workers, persisted runs, restart recovery, and live SignalR progress updates.
- Added richer evidence fusion across MusicBrainz, AcoustID, SongRec, transcripts, OCR, comments, chapters, provenance, perturbation probes, Panako, Audfprint, and Demucs-backed artifact generation.
- Added ranked handoff actions for song search, album preparation, direct album jobs, discography jobs, and multi-candidate fan-out.
- Added split identity vs synthetic assessments and unobtrusive forensic / synthetic UI surfacing so strong identity still drives acquisition decisions.
- **Forensic context** — lane-level forensic matrix (identity, provenance, spectral, descriptor, lyrics, structural, generator family, confidence), `topEvidenceFor`/`topEvidenceAgainst`, `perturbationStability`, `qualityClass`, `knownFamilyScore`, and C2PA provenance hints now arrive with every run.
- **Infinite queue & configurable workers** — the queue now keeps queue position/worker slot in SQLite, recovers on restart, accepts unlimited submissions, and obeys `songid-max-concurrent-runs` / `SONGID_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` so `X` workers process runs at a time.
- **Ranked acquisition & mix planning** — track/album/discography options rely on identity-first scoring, mix decomposition yields `Split Into Track Plans`, and candidate fan-outs (`Search Top Candidates`) preserve Byzantine/quality ordering for actionable downloads.

### Discovery Graph / Constellation

- Added the first native `Discovery Graph` / `Constellation` substrate.
- Added backend graph API/service for typed, weighted, explainable neighborhoods seeded from SongID runs, tracks, albums, artists, and fallback metadata seeds.
- Added graph launch surfaces in SongID, MusicBrainz lookup, and search-result cards.
- Added inline mini-map and modal graph UI with edge filtering, recentering, queue-nearby actions, pinning, comparison overlays, and saved branch snapshots.
- Added MusicBrainz artist release-group expansion and richer edge provenance / score-component / evidence payloads for graph explanations.
- Added broader search summon points plus an in-page atlas panel with semantic zoom controls and saved-branch restore.
- Added a dedicated `/discovery-graph` route plus modal handoff into that full atlas workspace.
- Enabled semantic zoom lockstep across mini-map, drawer modal, and atlas so provenance/score-component detail follows any neighborhood while graph actions (`queue nearby`, downloads, compare) reuse that same substrate.

- Logged at Information level: `"Cancelling active transfers for N newly blacklisted user(s): [...]"`

### Per-Group File Type Restrictions (#56)

- Added `AllowedFileTypes string[]` to `Options.GroupsOptions.UploadOptions` (the upload config shared by all user groups including user-defined groups, Default, and Leechers).
- When `AllowedFileTypes` is non-empty for a group, the upload handler checks the requested file's extension against the list before enqueuing.
- Rejects with `DownloadEnqueueException("File type .ext is not permitted.")` if not matched (case-insensitive).
- Empty list (default) means no restriction — fully backwards-compatible.

  - **Friend Codes**: Short, shareable Base32-encoded codes (e.g., `ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP`) derived from PeerId for easy copy/paste.
  - **Invite Links**: Self-contained `FriendInvite` payloads encoded as `slskdn://invite/...` links with QR code support (WebUI pending).
  - **mDNS LAN Discovery**: Automatic peer discovery on local networks via mDNS (`_slskdn._tcp.local`). Raw UDP socket implementation for advertising; Zeroconf library for browsing.
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `GET/PUT /api/v0/profile/me` - Manage own profile
    - `GET /api/v0/profile/{peerId}` - Fetch peer profiles (public)
    - `POST /api/v0/profile/invite` - Generate invite links
    - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v0/contacts` - Contact CRUD
    - `POST /api/v0/contacts/from-invite` - Add contact from invite
    - `POST /api/v0/contacts/from-discovery` - Add contact from LAN discovery
    - `GET /api/v0/contacts/nearby` - Browse nearby peers
  - **Feature Flag**: `feature.identity_friends` (default: `false`). All endpoints return 404 when disabled.
  - **Dependencies**: `Zeroconf` 3.0.30 (for mDNS browsing), `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` (for contact storage).
  - **Tests**: 90 unit tests covering ProfileService, ContactService, ContactRepository, ProfileController, ContactsController, LanDiscoveryService, and MdnsAdvertiser.

### ShareGroups, Collections & Sharing (Phases 1-2)

- **ShareGroups & Collections System** (`feature.collections_sharing`): Content organization and sharing infrastructure.
  - **ShareGroups**: User-created groups for organizing sharing audiences. `ShareGroup` and `ShareGroupMember` entities with ownership and membership management.
  - **Collections**: Content collections (ShareLists and Playlists) with `Collection` and `CollectionItem` entities. Support for ordering via `Ordinal`.
  - **Share Grants**: Capability-based sharing via `ShareGrant` with `SharePolicy` (AllowStream, AllowDownload, AllowReshare, expiry, concurrency limits).
  - **Content Resolution**: `IContentLocator` interface and implementation for resolving content IDs to local file paths and MIME types. Integrates with `IShareRepository` and `IsAdvertisable` checks.
  - **Share Tokens**: `IShareTokenService` with JWT-based capability tokens. Tokens include collection ID, capabilities, expiry, and max concurrent streams. Constant-time validation.
  - **Sharing Service**: `ISharingService` for managing groups, collections, share grants, and manifest generation.
  - **Repositories**: `IShareGroupRepository`, `ICollectionRepository`, `IShareGrantRepository` with SQLite-backed implementations via `CollectionsDbContext`.
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v0/sharegroups` - ShareGroup CRUD
    - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v0/collections` - Collection CRUD
    - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v0/shares` - ShareGrant CRUD
    - `POST /api/v0/shares/{id}/token` - Generate share token
    - `GET /api/v0/shares/{id}/manifest` - Get collection manifest
  - **Feature Flag**: `feature.collections_sharing` (default: `false`). All endpoints return 404 when disabled. (Note: flag name in code is `CollectionsSharing`).
  - **Tests**: 67 unit tests across 5 test files covering ShareTokenService, SharingService, CollectionsController, ShareGroupsController, and SharesController.

### Streaming (Phases 3-4)

- **Streaming API** (`feature.streaming`): HTTP range request support for content streaming.
  - **Stream Session Limiting**: `IStreamSessionLimiter` with configurable concurrent stream limits per content ID.
  - **Stream Endpoint**: `GET /api/v0/streams/{contentId}` with support for HTTP range requests (`Range` header).
  - **Authentication**: Supports both token-based (share tokens) and normal user authentication.
  - **Content Resolution**: Uses `IContentLocator` (from Phase 1) to resolve content IDs to local file paths and MIME types.
  - **Session Management**: `ReleaseOnDisposeStream` wrapper ensures limiter slots are released on stream disposal.
  - **Feature Flag**: `feature.streaming` (default: `false`). Endpoint returns 404 when disabled.
  - **Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for StreamSessionLimiter, ReleaseOnDisposeStream, ContentLocator, and StreamsController.

- **Mesh Search Improvements** (Phase 4): Enhanced mesh search with better deduplication and query limits.
  - **Query Limits**: Added query length cap (256 chars) and time cap (5 seconds) in `MeshSearchRpcHandler` to prevent abuse.
  - **Enhanced DTOs**: `MeshSearchFileDto` now includes optional `MediaKinds`, `ContentId`, and `Hash` fields for better content matching.
  - **Improved Deduplication**: `SearchResponseMerger` now uses normalized filenames (case-insensitive, path separator normalization) for cross-response deduplication.
  - **Media Kind Detection**: Automatic detection of media types (Music, Video, Image) from file extensions in `MeshSearchRpcHandler`.
  - **MeshParallelSearch Flag**: `feature.mesh_parallel_search` flag wired to enable parallel mesh search alongside Soulseek. Works with `VirtualSoulfind.MeshSearch.Enabled` (either flag can enable).

- **Relay Streaming Fallback** (Phase 5): ContentId-based streaming through relay agents.
  - **IMeshContentFetcher**: New interface and implementation for fetching content from mesh overlay network by ContentId with size and hash validation.
  - **Relay Streaming Endpoint**: `GET /api/v0/relay/streams/{contentId}` endpoint for streaming content through relay agents using ContentId instead of filename.
  - **Content Resolution**: Endpoint resolves ContentId to filename via `IContentLocator`, then uses existing relay file streaming mechanism.
  - **Feature Flag**: `feature.streaming_relay_fallback` (default: `false`). Endpoint returns 503 when disabled.
  - **Validation**: `MeshContentFetcher` performs size and SHA-256 hash validation when expected values are provided.

### Mesh Network Resilience

- **Fault-Tolerant UDP Overlay**: UDP overlay server now gracefully handles port binding failures, allowing mesh to operate behind firewalls.
  - **Graceful Degradation**: When UDP overlay port (default 50305) cannot be bound (e.g., already in use, firewall blocked), the mesh continues operating in degraded mode.
  - **Preserved Functionality**: DHT operations, relay/beacon services, and hole punching continue to function even without direct inbound UDP connections.
  - **Clear Logging**: Warning messages clearly explain degraded mode operation and which features remain available.
  - **Consistent Error Handling**: Matches the fault-tolerant pattern used by QUIC overlay servers.
  - **Use Case**: Enables mesh operation behind firewalls where port forwarding is not available, relying on outbound connections, DHT, and relay services for connectivity.

### User Interface Improvements

- **Logs Page Enhancements**: Improved log viewing experience with reduced noise and filtering capabilities.
  - **CSRF Logging Noise Reduction**: CSRF Debug logs for safe HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) and successful validations changed to Verbose level, reducing noise in default log views.
  - **Log Level Filtering**: Added filter buttons (All, Info, Warn, Error, Debug) to the logs page for easy filtering by log level.
  - **Log Count Display**: Shows count of filtered logs vs total logs (e.g., "Showing 50 of 500 logs").
  - **Improved Readability**: Users can now focus on specific log levels (warnings, errors) without scrolling through verbose debug information.

### Security & hardening (40-fixes, dev/40-fixes)

- **EnforceSecurity** (`web.enforce_security`): When `true`, enables strict auth, CORS, startup checks via `HardeningValidator`, and automatic 400 for invalid `ModelState` (`SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter = false`). Use for repeatable hardened testing.
- **Passthrough AllowedCidrs** (`web.authentication.passthrough.allowed_cidrs`): Optional CIDR allowlist for no-auth mode (e.g. `127.0.0.1/32,::1/128`) in addition to loopback. PR-03.
- **CORS** (`web.cors`): `allowed_headers`, `allowed_methods`; allowlist semantics; no `AllowAll` + `AllowCredentials`. PR-04.
- **Exception handler**: RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails`, `traceId`; in Production, generic detail (no internal leak). PR-05.
- **Dump endpoint**: Returns **501** when dump creation fails (e.g. `dotnet-dump` not on PATH, `DiagnosticsClient` failure) with instructions. `diagnostics.allow_memory_dump`, `allow_remote_dump`; admin-only, local-only when `allow_remote_dump` false. PR-06.
- **ModelState / RejectInvalidModelState**: `web.api.reject_invalid_model_state`; when Enforce, invalid payloads return 400 with consistent `ValidationProblemDetails`. PR-07.
- **MeshGateway**: Chunked POST supported; bounded body read; 413 on over-limit. PR-08.
- **Kestrel MaxRequestBodySize** (`web.max_request_body_size`): Configurable request body limit (default 10 MB). PR-09a.
- **Rate limit fed/mesh**: `Burst_federation_inbox_*`, `Burst_mesh_gateway_*` policies; `web.rate_limiting`. PR-09b.
- **QuicDataServer**: Read/limits aligned with `GetEffectiveMaxPayloadSize`. §8.
- **Metrics Basic Auth**: Constant-time comparison (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals`); `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="metrics"`. §9.
- **§11 NotImplementedException gating**: Incomplete features (I2P, RelayOnly, PerceptualHasher, etc.) fail at startup or return 501 when enabled; no `NotImplementedException` crash in configured defaults.
- **ScriptService**: Async read of stdout/stderr, `WaitForExitAsync`, timeout and process kill; no `WaitForExit()` deadlock. J.

### Mesh

- **Mesh:Security** (`mesh.security`): `enforceRemotePayloadLimits`, `maxRemotePayloadSize`; safe MessagePack/JSON deserialization, overlay/transport caps.
- **Mesh:SyncSecurity** (`mesh.sync_security`): Rate limiting, quarantine, proof-of-possession, consensus, alert thresholds (T-1432–T-1435). See `docs/security/mesh-sync-security.md`.
- **Phase 12 Database Poisoning Protection**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (Jan 2026). All 10 tasks (T-1430 through T-1439) implemented including Ed25519 signature verification, reputation integration, rate limiting, automatic quarantine, proof-of-possession challenges, cross-peer consensus, security metrics, comprehensive tests, and documentation. See `docs/security/mesh-sync-security.md` and `docs/security/database-poisoning-tasks.md` for details.

### Anonymity / transports

- **I2PTransport**: SAM v3.1 STREAM CONNECT with `host` as I2P destination (base64 or `.b32.i2p`). `AnonymityTransportSelector` registers I2P when `AnonymityMode.I2P`. §11: enabling without SAM bridge fails at startup or 501.
- **RelayOnlyTransport**: RELAY_TCP over data overlay; `IOverlayDataPlane.OpenBidirectionalStreamAsync`; `QuicDataServer` handles `RELAY_TCP`. **`RelayPeerDataEndpoints`** (`security.adversarial.anonymity.relay_only.relay_peer_data_endpoints`): list of `host:port` for each relay’s QUIC data overlay; used when `TrustedRelayPeers` are not resolved. Required for RelayOnly until peer-id resolution. §11: enabling without endpoints/TrustedRelayPeers fails at startup or 501.

### Audio / MediaCore

- **AudioUtilities.ExtractPcmSamples**: Via ffmpeg; `ExtractPcmSamplesAsync`. Test expects `FileNotFoundException` when file missing (replacing `FeatureNotImplementedException`).

### Multi-Source Downloads & Swarm Scheduling

- **Chunk Reassignment Logic (T-1405)**: Enhanced swarm download orchestration with automatic chunk reassignment from degraded peers.
  - **Assignment Tracking**: `IChunkScheduler` now tracks active chunk assignments via `RegisterAssignment`/`UnregisterAssignment` methods
  - **Degradation Handling**: `HandlePeerDegradationAsync` returns list of chunk indices to reassign when peer performance degrades
  - **Automatic Re-queuing**: `SwarmDownloadOrchestrator` detects degraded peers and automatically re-queues their assigned chunks for reassignment to better peers
  - **Implementation**: Works with both `ChunkScheduler` and `MediaCoreChunkScheduler` for cost-based and content-aware scheduling
  - **Benefits**: Improves download reliability by quickly shifting work away from underperforming peers to maintain optimal swarm performance

- **Jobs API Enhancements (T-1410)**: Enhanced `/api/jobs` endpoint with pagination, sorting, and improved filtering.
  - **Pagination**: `limit` and `offset` query parameters (default limit: 100)
  - **Sorting**: `sortBy` parameter supports `status`, `created_at`, or `id`; `sortOrder` parameter supports `asc`/`desc` (default: `desc`)
  - **Default Sorting**: Jobs sorted by `created_at` descending (newest first) when no sort specified
  - **Enhanced Response**: Includes `total`, `limit`, `offset`, and `has_more` fields for pagination metadata
  - **Enhanced Job Objects**: Job objects now include `created_at` timestamp and `progress` object with `releases_total`, `releases_done`, `releases_failed` for better sorting and filtering
  - **Use Case**: Enables efficient job management in UIs with large numbers of jobs, supporting pagination and sorting by status or creation date

### Legacy Client Compatibility Bridge

- **Bridge Proxy Server Testing (T-851)**: Expanded test coverage for bridge protocol parser.
  - **Additional Unit Tests**: Added 7 new edge case tests for `SoulseekProtocolParser` covering:
    - Empty string handling (username, password, query)
    - Long filename handling (1000+ characters)
    - Invalid message length handling
    - Message roundtrip validation (write then read)
    - Empty file/room list handling
  - **Test Coverage**: All 15 protocol parser tests passing (8 original + 7 new)
  - **Benefits**: Improved confidence in protocol parser robustness and edge case handling

### Test infrastructure

- **test-data/slskdn-test-fixtures**: Fetch scripts, `manifest.json`, `.gitignore` for download artifacts.

### Breaking / behavior changes

- **EnforceSecurity on**: No-auth + non-loopback bind requires `allow_remote_no_auth: true` or startup fails. CORS `AllowCredentials` + wildcard origin fails startup. Dump enabled + auth disabled fails startup. `Flags.HashFromAudioFileEnabled` + Enforce fails startup (not implemented).
- **Dump**: Default `allow_memory_dump: false`; 501 when creation fails (no silent empty or 500).
- **CORS**: When enabled, require explicit `allowed_origins` when `allow_credentials: true`; no wildcard + credentials.
